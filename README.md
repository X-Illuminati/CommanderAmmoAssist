# CommanderAmmoAssist
Lua mod for Natural Selection 2 that augments the overhead view for the commander and displays an icon next to players who are requesting ammo/medkit.
Available in the [steam workshop](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=201177756).

ModID: bfdba9c

## Features
When an Ammo request alert is received, a small ammo icon will be shown near the player who issued the request.
This way, you will be able to tell which player in a group needs ammo.
Similar behavior will occur with medpack, need order, enzyme, and nutrient mist requests.
